            <span className="font-bold text-blue-400 text-lg sm:text-xl">Problem</span>
            <p className="text-lg sm:text-lg">The idea for Bracket Madness started with a frustrating user experience in a major bracket challenge app. The interface forced users into a rigid step-by-step flow, which made it difficult to move freely between different regions and rounds. For users who prefer a more strategic or intuitive approach — jumping between rounds, revisiting early picks, or scanning the full picture — the experience felt restrictive and disjointed.

            Bracket Madness was built to solve that with a more flexible, user-first interface. Mobile users get visual cues like dot indicators to show missing picks by round, while tablet and desktop users see color-coded game slots to help them track progress and stay oriented. A visible pick counter keeps users aware of how close they are to completion, removing friction from the process.

            Beyond the UX improvements, the app introduces private pools as a central feature. Instead of competing anonymously in a sea of millions, users can create invite-only challenges with coworkers, friends, or family — making it easy to track who&#39;s winning in a familiar group. It brings back the social energy of office pools, but with modern design and seamless digital tools.</p>

          <span className="font-bold text-blue-400 text-lg sm:text-xl">Goal</span>
            <p className="text-lg sm:text-lg">Build a secure full-stack app where users can play individually or in groups, competing in a bracket-based prediction game. The platform features a custom scoring system, game results updated automatically every 10 minutes, and a dynamic user experience, while amplifying visibility for women&#39;s sports.</p>

        <span className="font-bold text-green-400 text-lg sm:text-xl">Outcome</span>
          <li className="text-lg sm:text-lg">The app allows users to create secure accounts, join or manage private pool challenges, and track performance across 67 games. It supports multiple brackets per user and uses a dynamic scoring engine with round multipliers and bonus points.

          <ul><span className="font-bold text-green-400 text-lg sm:text-xl">Vision</span>
            <p className="text-lg sm:text-lg">Bracket Madness is just the beginning. While the MVP focuses on college basketball, the broader vision is to create a fan engagement platform centered on women&#39;s sports, spanning multiple leagues and competition formats. The platform is designed to support a wide range of fan types — from casual followers to die-hard enthusiasts — through features like dynamic challenges, in-app currency, and a community-driven social experience. Currently in stealth mode, the project aims to contribute to the growth of women&#39;s sports by introducing new, interactive ways for fans to connect with the game and with each other.</p>
